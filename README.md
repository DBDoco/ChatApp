## Installing dependencies
1. Install Node.js
Angular requires Node.js, so make sure you have it installed. If not, you can download and install it from the official website: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js Download</a>

2. Install Angular CLI
Angular CLI is a command-line interface for Angular, and it helps you create, build, test, and deploy Angular applications. Install Angular CLI globally using npm (Node Package Manager):

```bash
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## How To Open On Localhost

Clone this repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/marinactonci/ChatApp.git
```

Go into the repository
```bash
$ cd ChatApp
```

While in the project directory, install the project dependencies using:
```bash
$ npm install
```

Start localhost server
```bash
$ ng serve -o
```

(The -o flag opens the application in your default web browser. After running this command, you should see your Angular app running locally.)
